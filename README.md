Regression has a lot of real-world applications which range from predicting health outcomes in medicine, stock prices in finance, and power usage in
high-performance computing, to analyzing which regulators are important for gene expression. In this course, I explored regularized linear regression
models for the task of prediction and feature selection. It makes it easier to handle very large sets of features and select between models of various
complexity. To fit these models, I implemented optimization algorithms that scale to large datasets.
